    "Semantic mapping was performed and two datasets were merged. A global schema was declared according to the dataset obtained after completing task 1 and 2. All other incorrect datatypes or column naming, missing values, duplications, and data conflict issues were solved. Moreover, ```Id``` column was defined as the global unique key for the final dataframe. At the end, the data was stored and saved to 'dataset_integrated.csv'\n"
